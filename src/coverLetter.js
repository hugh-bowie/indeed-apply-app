const cvrLetter = [`Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Full Stack Developer position at your company. With over six years of experience as a firefighter and paramedic, I have developed strong problem-solving skills, excellent communication abilities, and a commitment to attention to detail that I believe would be valuable assets in this role.

In my previous position, I was responsible for responding as a team to emergency 911 calls, which required me to work effectively as a team member under life or death pressure. I believe that this experience, along with my age of 39, brings a level of maturity and professionalism to the job that would be beneficial to your team. 

Pursuing a career change and learning to code in my thirties has been a challenging and enriching experience. It has honed my ability to approach errors with positivity and persevere in achieving my goals. I am eager to further develop my skills as a Full Stack Developer and believe that your company would provide the ideal environment for me to do so.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to join your team and contribute my skills and experience to the success of your company.

Sincerely,
Hugh Bowie`];
